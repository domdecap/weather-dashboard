A searchable weather dashboard

This is a weather dashboard that shows you current weather and a 5 day forecast fort whatever city you search. Along with high and low temps for the day, you are also given wind speed, humidty, and the description of the current weather.

## Usage

All you have to do is search for a city to get the curtrent weather, along with a 5 day forecast!

## Contributors

I had help with my tutor Ntombi, as well as ChatGPT to help debug some problems I was having with the dashboard not returning any city information.
